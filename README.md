# linuxScripts

A collection of BASH scripts I've created over the course of my professional career to assist in day to day tasks. 

## Overview 
Scripts in **gcp** are for Google Cloud Platform. <br>
Scripts in **helper** are programs designed for specific cases. <br>
Scripts in **concepts** are works-in-progress or for demonstrating concepts. <br>
Each folder has it's own README explaining what each script in the folder does.
