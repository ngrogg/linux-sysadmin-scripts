# Linux Sysadmin Scripts

## Overview
A collection of BASH scripts I've created to assist in day to day tasks. Vaguely related to my Google Cloud scripts repo linked [here](https://github.com/ngrogg/google-cloud-cli-scripts) but more general.
Scripts in **scripts** are scripts I've written that are ready to go. They may need minor adjustments for your own systems, but should largely drop-in. <br>
