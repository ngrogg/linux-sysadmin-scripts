# Linux Sysadmin Scripts

A collection of BASH scripts I've created to assist in day to day tasks. Vaguely related to my Google Cloud scripts repo linked [here](https://github.com/ngrogg/google-cloud-cli-scripts) but more general.

## Overview
Scripts in **scripts** are scripts I've written that are ready to go. They may need minor adjustments for your own systems, but should largely drop-in. <br>
Scripts in **concepts** are works-in-progress or for demonstrating concepts. <br>
Any non-conceptual scripts in that folder should not be run on production systems. <br>
Each folder has it's own README explaining what each script in the folder does.
